### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__:   **Meets Expectations**

* __Technical Requirements__:  **Meets Expectations**

* __Problem Solving__: **Meets Expectations**

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?
