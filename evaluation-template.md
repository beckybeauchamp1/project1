### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__:   **Meets Expectations**

I really like that you included your bronze, silver and gold within your project README!

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__:  **Meets Expectations**


Your game is functional and you were able to effectively manipulate the DOM to show questions, answers, and compare each of them to show correctness at the end.

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Code Quality__: **Meets Expectations**

I really love that you put your methods and properties into one object! That was awesome to see. I think most of your improvement really is just refactoring and condensing your callback functions into one. Overall, your code is very clean and modular, great to see!

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: **Meets Expectations**

Great job, you were able to solve your problem and complete project 1! I you will find it useful to continue breaking down your problem into smaller steps. 

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?
